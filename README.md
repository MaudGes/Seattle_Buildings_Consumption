# Seattle_Buildings_Consumption
The objective of the city of Seattle is to be carbon neutral by 2050.  To achieve this, surveys were conducted by agents in 2015 and 2016. These surveys are tedious and require a lot of work, so the city wants to attempt to predict the data for non-residential buildings that have not yet been surveyed.

To achieve this goal, several models were tested on both energy consumption prediction and greenhouse gas emissions : Linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting and linear SVR.
The best results were given by Random forest.

It seems that the energy consumption predictions could be relevant but, Greenhouse Gas emissions are harder to accurately predict using the tested ML models.
