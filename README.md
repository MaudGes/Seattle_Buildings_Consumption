# Seattle_Buildings_Consumption
The objective of the city of Seattle is to be carbon neutral by 2050.  To achieve this, surveys were conducted by agents in 2015 and 2016. These surveys are tedious and require a lot of work, so the city wants to attempt to predict the data for non-residential buildings that have not yet been surveyed.
